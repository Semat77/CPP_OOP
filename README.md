# Shapes Calculator

This C++ program allows users to input and calculate properties of different geometric shapes.

## Motivation

I created this project with the goal of learning and practicing the latest object-oriented programming concepts in C++17. By implementing various geometric shapes and their properties, I aimed to deepen my understanding of modern C++ features and design principles.

## Shapes

- **Circle:** ...
- **Rectangle:** ...
- **Triangle:** ...

## Usage

To run the program, compile and execute the `main.cpp` file.

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o shapes_calculator
./shapes_calculator
